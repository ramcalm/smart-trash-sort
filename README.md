Automate Waste Classification using IOT & ML

## What it does?
<ul>
<li>We have designed this system by using a camera interfaced with Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>When trash is placed on the system, the camera is triggered to take a picture and Raspberry Pi sends it to the Heroku Cloud where we have deployed our Deep Learning model.</li>
<li>This DL image classification algorithm runs to decide if the waste being disposed is biodegradable or non-biodegradable.</li>
<li>The result is sent back to the Raspberry Pi module which then triggers motors which slides the trash into their respective bins.</li>
<li>We have created a frontend system, where we can view the activity of the bin. </li>
</ul>
